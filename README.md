# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

Welcome to Jupyter!

Jupyter is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

Jupyter notebooks, the primary interface for working with Jupyter, consist of a series of cells that can contain code, markdown text, or raw text. You can run code in a cell and see the output right below it. This makes it easy to experiment with code and explore data interactively.

Jupyter notebooks support a variety of programming languages including Python, R, Julia, and more. You can switch between different languages and run code written in different languages within the same notebook.

Jupyter also supports a variety of data visualization tools, including matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. You can create interactive visualizations and share them with others in your notebook.

With Jupyter, you can collaborate with others by sharing your notebooks on GitHub, using version control to track changes, and commenting on each other's work.

To get started with Jupyter, you can install it on your computer using Anaconda or directly using pip. Once installed, you can launch Jupyter by running the command jupyter notebook in your terminal. You can then create a new notebook and start working with code, text, and data.

Jupyter is an incredibly powerful tool that can help you explore, analyze, and communicate your data and ideas
